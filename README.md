# Data_Visualization_Credit_Risk_Analysis
This project explores data visualization techniques in R. It includes data cleaning, analysis, and the creation of visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts using ggplot2 and tidyverse to highlight key patterns and insights in the dataset.

This repository contains the work completed for **Data Visualization Assignment 2** in R.  
The project explores data visualization techniques in R using `ggplot2` and other relevant packages.

## Contents

- `Data Visualization Assignment2.Rproj` – RStudio project file to manage the workspace.
- `scripts/` – R scripts containing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization code.
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets used in the assignment.
- `plots/` – Exported charts and visualizations.

## Key Work Completed

- Imported and cleaned dataset(s) for analysis.
- Created a range of visualizations including:
  - Histograms and density plots for distribution analysis
  - Scatter plots with trend lines for correlation analysis
  - Boxplots and violin plots for comparison between groups
  - Heatmaps and bar charts for categorical insights
- Applied appropriate themes, labels, and color palettes for clarity and aesthetics.
- Interpreted results to highlight patterns and insights from the data.

## Requirements

- R (≥ 4.0)
- RStudio (optional, recommended)
- Packages:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`
  - `tidyr`
  - `readr`
  - `cowplot` (or other visualization helpers)

Install dependencies with:
